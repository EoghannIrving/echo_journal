## Phase 4: Archive + Stats foundation for enrichment ‚úÖ Completed

- Expanded Archive view:  
  - Show metadata presence (üìçlocation, üå¶Ô∏èweather, üì∑photo marker).  
  - Optional sorting/filtering by enrichment.  
- Stats dashboard: ‚úÖ Completed  
  - Entry count by week/month/year.  
  - Word count stats.  
  - Optional "streaks" tracking (days/weeks with consecutive entries).

  - Ensure clean fallback for legacy `.md` files.  
- Optional enrichment integration readiness:  
  - Immich (photos).  
  - Geolocation.  
  - Weather API.  
  - AI-assisted prompts (‚ÄúNeed inspiration?‚Äù feature).  
  - Optional "New Prompt" link to gently refresh the daily suggestion if it doesn't resonate.  
    - Subtle secondary text that fades in on hover/tap.  
    - Client-side localStorage ensures the prompt stays consistent after saving.  
  - Optional secure remote access (auth, VPN/reverse proxy).  

## Phase 5: Enrichment and polish (in progress)

### Backdated journaling support
- Allow user to create/edit entries for past dates  
- UI clearly shows: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre writing for {{date}}‚Äù (date banner)  
- Prompt uses past-tense framing (e.g., ‚ÄúLooking back‚Ä¶‚Äù)  
- Show contextual memory joggers:
  - Weather for that day  
  - Photos from Immich  
  - Songs or TV shows via Jellyfin/Last.fm  
  - Time clues (e.g., ‚ÄúYou started your day with‚Ä¶‚Äù)  
- Fallback message if no metadata available  
- ‚ÄúBack to Today‚Äù link for easy return to current entry  

### Enrichment and UX Enhancements

- **Auto-generated prompt selection**  
  - Uses contextual signals (Jellyfin, Immich, Last.fm, local time, weather)  
  - Backend rules or scoring engine selects from `prompts.json`  
  - Contextual input logged into `.meta.json` or frontmatter  

- **Minimalist journal screen mode**  
  - One visible prompt only  
  - No toolbar or menus  
  - Prompt gently faded in for clarity  
  - Triggered by URL query or persistent setting  

- **Expanded 10-second journaling mode**  
  - No refresh or formatting  
  - Designed for raw, low-pressure reflection  
  - Auto-save on blur or idle timeout (optional)  

- **Full ambient metadata capture**  
  - Mood, time block, weather, Jellyfin/Last.fm/Immich content  
  - Files created: `.songs.json`, `.media.json`, `.photos.json`, `.meta.json`  
  - Example YAML frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    mood: Energized
    time_block: evening
    weather: Cloudy, 73¬∞F
    songs_played: 4
    photos: 2
    tv: ["Doctor Who"]
    ```

- **Smart append-to-entry mode**  
  - Detects existing entry for the day  
  - Inserts separator (`---` or timestamp) for each append  
  - Preserves single-entry-per-day model  
  - ‚ÄúAdd to Today‚Äôs Journal‚Äù button shown if applicable  
  - Metadata for each append saved to `.meta.json` as list  

## Phase 6: Insight, Patterning, and Personalization (planned)

- Filter archive view by mood, energy, tags  
- Mood/energy calendar view (heatmap style)  
- Personal time capsule: ‚ÄúSend to Future Me‚Äù  
  - Choose future date to show message  
- Prompt lane selector: Sensory | Reflective | Planning | Memory  
- Micro-nudge fallback for empty textarea  
  - Quote, image, or ‚ÄúNeed a seed?‚Äù option  
- Export to PDF or memory cards  

## Design Guardrails

- Prioritize warmth and ultra-low friction  
- Markdown format for longevity and openness  
- Support single-action journaling: open ‚Üí type ‚Üí save  
- Clear UI/API separation using FastAPI + Jinja2
