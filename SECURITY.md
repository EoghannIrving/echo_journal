# Security Policy

Echo Journal is intended for use on a trusted local network. The app includes
optional HTTP Basic authentication that can be enabled by setting the
`BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables. Without
those variables, there is no builtâ€‘in authentication. **Do not expose the
application directly to the internet.** If you deploy publicly, enable Basic
Auth and place the app behind a secure reverse proxy with additional access
controls. Refer to [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for guidance on
secure configuration and reverse proxy examples.
